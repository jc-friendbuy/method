This is **method**.  It is a simple, basic, machine learning modeling framework for Python, built with `scikit-learn`.

Currently, it's in pre-alpha stages (it doesn't really run yet in this build), as it is taken from my work on my Masters thesis, which has been in R for the most part so far.  As I build on it, I'll update this document and create build and test scripts that will better illustrate how it works.

Please feel free to look through the code and send any feedback my way!
